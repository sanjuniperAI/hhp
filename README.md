## ðŸš€ What is HHP?

The **Hyper Human Protocol** (HHP) is an open, extensible standard for explicit, auditable, and revocable data access in AI-driven applications. HHP ensures every interaction is:

- **User-Authorized** â€“ Consent collected at the scope level  
- **Device-Bound** â€“ Cryptographically tied to your hardware fingerprint  
- **Risk-Tiered** â€“ Short-lived tickets minimize misuse  
- **Revocable** â€“ Instant multichannel revocation (WebSocket + SMS/Email + adaptive pulls)  
- **Auditable** â€“ Tamper-evident logs anchored via hybrid Merkle trees
